**RSM** is a C++ 11 header only library for random and quasi-random sampling. It provides implementations of fast pseudorandom number generators, variance reducing and low discrepancy samplers, a collection of functions transforming uniform samples into other distributions, and various auxiliary utilities.

It's aimed mainly at Monte Carlo applications with a somewhat strong bias towards computer graphics.

*(This is a work in progress. Proper documentation & usage examples will materialize soon.)*
